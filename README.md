## Introduction

The Augmented Nature UniProt MCP Server is designed to facilitate advanced research in bioinformatics and related fields. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol, users can interact with the UniProt database efficiently. This server is ideal for those involved in drug discovery, phylogenetics, and proteomics.

### What is UniProt?

UniProt is a comprehensive protein sequence and functional information database. It provides researchers with high-quality protein data, making it essential for studies in various biological fields.

## Features

- **Advanced Access**: The server offers a user-friendly interface for accessing UniProt data.
- **Model Context Protocol**: Utilize the MCP for enhanced data interaction.
- **Integration with AI**: Incorporate AI tools like Smithery for data analysis.
- **Support for Multiple Topics**: Covers bioinformatics, drug design, phylogenetics, and more.

## Installation

To set up the Augmented Nature UniProt MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thiagomenezes12/Augmented-Nature-UniProt-MCP-Server.git
   cd Augmented-Nature-UniProt-MCP-Server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   Start the server using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

You can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/Thiagomenezes12/Augmented-Nature-UniProt-MCP-Server/releases) section for pre-built binaries.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`. The interface allows you to:

- Search for proteins by name or ID.
- Retrieve detailed protein information.
- Explore related proteins and functions.

### Example Queries

Here are a few example queries you can perform:

1. **Search by Protein Name**:
   Enter a protein name in the search bar to get detailed information.

2. **Retrieve by UniProt ID**:
   Input a UniProt ID to access specific protein data.

3. **Explore Related Proteins**:
   Use the interface to find proteins related to your search.

## API Documentation

The Augmented Nature UniProt MCP Server includes a RESTful API for programmatic access. Here are some key endpoints:

- **GET /api/proteins**: Retrieve a list of proteins.
- **GET /api/proteins/{id}**: Get details for a specific protein.
- **POST /api/proteins/search**: Search for proteins based on parameters.

### Example API Call

To retrieve a protein by ID, you can use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/proteins/P12345
```
